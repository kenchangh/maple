#### Fast, web-oriented programming language

Introduction
------------

Normally, when we want to develop a website or web service, we would normally reach out for Rails and Django. Wait, did I say **Rails and Django**?! Aren't they **web frameworks**?!

To me, an awesome web programming language has to be so well designed that there's only one possible way of doing things. The programming language should BE the web framework.

Now, yes there's always PHP, but then all of us are well aware about its horrors right?

Maple intends to be just that - a PHP, but a 10x better one.
